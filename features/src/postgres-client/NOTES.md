## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed.

## Notes

NOTE: This feature does not install the dependencies needed for the Postgres server.
For that we recommend running a service using the official
[Postgres docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).
