## OS Support

This Feature should work on recent versions of Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions with the `apt` package manager installed.

## Notes

NOTE: This feature does not install the dependencies needed for the MySQL Server. For that we
recommend running a service using the official
[MySQL docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).
